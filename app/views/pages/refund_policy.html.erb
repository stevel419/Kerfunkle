      <h1>REFUND POLICY</h1>
      
      <p><strong>Returns</strong></p>
      <p>Our policy lasts for 14 days for all orders of any new Kerfunkle item. If 14 days have gone by since your purchase, we, unfortunately, cannot offer you a refund or exchange.</p>
      <p>To be eligible for a return, your item must be unused and in the same condition that you received it. It must also be in the original packaging.</p>
      <p>To complete your return, we require a receipt or proof of purchase.</p>
      <p>Please do not send your purchase back to the distributor.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Refunds (if applicable)</strong></p>
      <p>Once your return request is received and inspected, we will send you an email to notify you that we have processed your return request along with instructions on how to complete the return. We will also notify you of the approval or rejection of your refund.</p>
      <p>If you are approved, then your refund will be processed, and a credit will automatically be applied to your credit card or original method of payment, within a certain amount of days.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Late or missing refunds (if applicable)</strong></p>
      <p>If you haven't received a refund yet, first check your bank account again. Then contact your credit card company, it may take some time before your refund is officially posted.</p>
      <p>Next contact your bank. There is often some processing time before a refund is posted.</p>
      <p>If you've done all of this and you still have not received your refund yet, please contact us at officialkerfunkle@gmail.com</p>
      
      <p><strong>Order Change Policy</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Due to the many moving parts, once an order is placed and shipped, we are unable to make changes.</li>
        <li>Our fulfillment team begins working on your order as soon as it's placed, so once an order is placed we can't cancel or make changes.</li>
        <li>Please email officialkerfunkle@gmail.com if you have any questions.</li>
